I recently completed a virtual internship with **Quantum Analytics**, a leading data science and AI firm. This program was an incredible opportunity that I invested in to enhance my skills and knowledge in data analytics. The internship offered a comprehensive learning experience, including:

- **Live Classes**: Interactive sessions with industry experts.
- **Recorded Sessions**: Access to all class recordings for flexible learning.
- **Certificate of Completion**: A valuable addition to my professional credentials.
